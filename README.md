CS-370 covers topics and methods in Artificial Intelligence, specifically Machine Learning. 

In this project, we were given the TreasureMaze class code with all the instaniated variables and methods.  We were also given the GameExperience class to remember episodes.  We created the qtrain() method which utilized the Epsilon-Greedy Q-Learning Method.  

A computer scientist uses mathematical, including statistical, proofs and theorems to apply prediction methods for answering questions about intelligence, business, and general problem solving.  Computer science is the new frontier in which human application meets understandings of the known universe, both tangible and intangible.  For example, tangile and discrete mathematical functions that describe the number of resources available for a population can then be used to discerne intangible predictions of when a resource may run out for a population that were observed and notated by brilliant minds of the past.  

As a computer scientist, it is my job to understand a problem at its most basic unit and use iterations and loops to solve the problem bit by bit. 

With the knowledge of what computers can do and process, I am responsbile for keeping people safe by educating, when possible, the dangers of information being inputted into systems and the capabilities that systems have that may be misunderstood by the population.
